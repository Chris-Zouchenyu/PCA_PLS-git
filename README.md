# PCA_PLS-git
PCA algorithm is used to reduce the dimension of data, and BP and CNN algorithms are used for regression analysis of data
The data is 'Near Infrared Spectra of Diesel Fuels' which comes from   
https://eigenvector.com/data/SWRI/index.html  
## Work
Firstly, I used PCA dimensionality reduction algorithm to visualize the data.  
Secondly, I used BP and CNN to build the data model of soft sensor.  
## Results
The prediction results of the two models are shown in the figure below:
